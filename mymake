🔐 To Change the Password:
If you want to set a new password:

Open your browser console (F12)
Run this command:
javascript

Security.hashPassword('your_new_password').then(hash => console.log(hash));
Copy the hash that appears
Open 
security-enhanced.js
Find line 24 and replace the hash:
javascript
const ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH = 'paste_your_hash_here';
Note: With the new security features, you'll be locked out for 5 minutes after 5 failed login attempts, and your session will automatically expire after 30 minutes of inactivity! 🔒
